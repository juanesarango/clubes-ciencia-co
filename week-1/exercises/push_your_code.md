# Push Your Code

Go back over any of the exercises and projects you've done recently that have been most instrumental to your learning. Work through the process of creating git repositories for these projects, commit your code and push it to Github.

From here on out, you should be tracking all of your code with git, and pushing your changes up to Github as frequently as possible. Make sure to use the best practices you've learned in order to form good habbits around version control:

- Make atomic commits that can be managed independently of one another.
- Write descriptive yet concise commit messages
- Commit and push early and often
