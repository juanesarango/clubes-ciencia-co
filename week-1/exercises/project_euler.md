# Project Euler

https://projecteuler.net

Project Euler is a collection of programming problems that can be solved in almost any programming language. In order to get ourselves back into the groove of programming we'll spend the rest of today working on selected problems from Project Euler. If you've seen a particular problem before or it seems a bit too easy to you, take the opportunity to learn more about refactoring and improve upon the first solution you come up with.

Unlike in the prep work, from here on out you will not be provided with test cases for any of of your exercises or projects. Our goal is to get you thinking and working like professional developers, and professional developers aren't provided with tests for the software they write - they write their own tests. So, as you go through these problems try to think about test cases on your own. We'll formalize this process tomorrow.
