## Pair Refactoring

Today, we're working on:
a) Pair programming
b) Refactoring our code

Working with your pair, pull up some of your old code. Ideally, try to find some problems that both of you have solutions to. Compare your solutions, and work together to write a new refactored solution to a few of these problems.
