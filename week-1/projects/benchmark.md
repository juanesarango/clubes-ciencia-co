# Benchmark

Ruby's standard library includes a module called Benchmark that you can use to precisely determine the running time of your code. This can be very useful if you need to approximate the real-world performance of different algorithms to determine which one is best for your particular application.

Go back through the days solutions and use `Benchmark` to verify the **Big-O** performance of your various solutions. You can find the docs [here][benchmark-docs]. Use different kinds of inputs of different sizes, and compare how the running time grows from smaller/more ideal arguments to larger/less ideal arguments.
