Computational biology merges the algorithmic thinking of the computer scientist with the problem solving approach of physics to address the problems of biology. Since the year 2000, an ocean of sequencing data has emerged that allows us to ask new questions.

Here we'll develop intuition for a selection of foundational problems in computational biology like genome reconstruction, sequence alignment, and building phylogenetic trees to look at evolutionary relationships. We also address certain physicochemical problems of molecular biology like RNA folding.

The bottleneck is however not the sequencing technology but various computational challenges like data analysis, visualization, integration and above all, the skills of the bioinformaticians have become a rate limiting step

WHAT IS LIFE? 
"All science is either physics or stamp collecting. That which is not measurable is not science." - Ernest Rutherford, known as the father of Nuclear physics.

Biology as a field of study occasionally gets little respect compared to its more quantitative cousins under the umbrellas of mathematics and physics. This isnâ€™t aided by the introduction to biology that many of us encounter early in our schooling: first comes the study of kingdoms, phyla, and species, and later the memorization of mitochondria, chloroplasts, and cellular nuclei. All in all; a pile of facts and details, some of them interesting, but disappointingly unconnected by unifying themes or quantitative principles.

But biology, the natural science that studies life and living organisms, does have a unifying principle that connects every organism that has ever existed on Earth, and even unknown organisms that may exist elsewhere in the universe.

Let's get to know the light that will guide the rest of this course


WHAT IS LIFE?
The diversity of life is astounding at nearly every scale: Humans are just one of the nearly six thousand different species of mammal. Other members of our furry and big-brained group have sizes spread over three orders of magnitude, from the bumblebee bat in the forests of Myanmar to the blue whale in the Antarctic Oceans.
